            Hello,honorable audience., Welcome to our red dragon efootball
            club.Our team was one of the first team to participate in Myanmar's
            e league since its establishment. We have been able to firmly prove
            ourselves as the big team in Myanmar.The achievements we have been
            owned by the third place in myanmar e league twice (season 3 and 4)
            and the entry into the Asian Champions League twice.We managed to
            find and recruit good efootball players in Myanmar in a systematic
            way and become a strong great,together with the managers and all the
            members of the team.Moving forward, we will try to introduce the
            most skilled,sharp and top-level players for the Myanmar efootball
            community.
